# Electronic-Cane-for-the-Blind
My team's senior design presention for our project before graduating.

To be able to build the electronic cane we have focused our attention into the real
problems and needs of potential users contacting blind and visually impaired organizations to
interview some of their members and research their needs. The interviews were conducted in
person, by phone and online messaging. The interviewees mentioned they mostly used the
traditional cane and very few of them use the walking aid dog to mobile and none of the
interviewees have used any kind of electronic devices for the visually impaired available in the
market right now mostly because of the price tag on the device being too high. The results from
this research are that what they need is a device designed to help them mobile inside unfamiliar
buildings such as offices and hospitals and outside to be able to walk on the bench. It is worth
mentioning that almost all of them mentioned they donâ€™t need any type of help within their own
house.
